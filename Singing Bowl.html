<h1>Singing Bowls</h1>

<p1>Singing bowls, also known as Tibetan singing bowls, are ancient, handcrafted metal bowls that produce a resonant sound when struck or circled with a mallet. Traditionally made from a mixture of metals such as copper, bronze, and sometimes silver or gold, these bowls come in various sizes and are often used in meditation, rituals, and healing practices. The sound produced by a singing bowl is a unique blend of harmonic overtones, which are believed to have therapeutic effects on the mind and body. When gently struck or rubbed around the rim with a mallet, they produce a soothing, vibrational sound that promotes relaxation and mindfulness. Singing bowls are intricately made by skilled artisans, often featuring delicate engravings or symbols that reflect Nepal's cultural and spiritual heritage. These bowls have been used for centuries, and their distinct tones are thought to resonate with the energy centers of the body, aiding in emotional and physical healing. </p1>
